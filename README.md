# Code Challenge 32(?) - Count The Characters
![picture](./src/assets/20181024_142812.jpg)
## Overview
Given a string, return a data structure that has both the corresponding letter and the amount of times that letter is used.

## Solution
Use a Map, storing values while iterating through the string. Check if it already exists before storing it. If it does, change the value of it by one.
Return the map.

## Running
`git clone` down to your machine, and then `npm i` `&&` `npm run test` while in the directory of the folder to run the tests themselves.

To use the function, either import it or require it.
